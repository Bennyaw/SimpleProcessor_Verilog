SimpleProcessor
=====
This processor is designed using *Verilog HDL* language in *Quartus* IDE. Also, to make sure it works properly in the hardware (Altera DE1 Development board), *Modelsim* IDE is used to create a testbench ot test code to eliminate any bugs or potential error.

This processor is broken down into 2 sections, which are **Datapath** and **Control Unit**. Datapath is responsible for processing data input from user and generates corrrect output. Control Unit gives command or direction for datapath to ensure specific operation is executed properly.
